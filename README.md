# Streaming Platform Analysis

## *Data Overview*
- I would like to preface this project with a brief introduction into the data that I analyzed
- The data contains 5,564 unique rows and nine unique columns which are as followed; Title, Year, Age, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and   Disney+ 
- The data that was used for the analysis was taken from Kaggle and the link can be found [*here*](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney). You can also view the raw data under the **tv_shows.csv** file in the repo

## *Project Overview*
- In the project I perform basic visualizations and give my opinions and analysis based on these visualizations
- I set out to become more fluent with Python and Data Visualization, as well as how to think critically when presented with data and what are important questions to ask based on the parameters of the data

## *Questions to Answer*
- Which streaming platform has the most TV shows?
